## HTML Notes

<head> tags are important for helping with search engine optimization. It includes the title of the page that search engines look at.

Apparently the browser caches random things. You can use ctrl-shift-r to hard reload the page and bypass the cache, which is useful for development.

<header> tags are used for the visible header section of a document, like the title that people will read, navigation sections, etc. You can also have a <nav> section within the header for the navigation part.

The <hr> tag adds a line across the page. The <br> tag adds a line break.

## CSS Notes

Make sure not to put a colon after style element property names in the @media section.

Make sure you specify px after border, margin and padding sizes.

Make sure to put the links to stylesheets in the right order in the HTML.

## React Notes

CSS with React is wonky, be really careful. Bootstrap doesn't turn out quite the same.
